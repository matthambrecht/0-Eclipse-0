> ## Portfolio
> - **EaqlDB**: A lightweight, in-memory database built for learning and prototyping. It uses EAQL, an English-like query language that can be transpiled to SQL or run directly. Ideal for teaching data concepts to beginner programmers.
> - **FaceSync**: Streamline analysis of CCTV footage for precise event timing using multi-CCTV body detection, powered by computer vision algorithms and implemented in C++.
> - **Translite**: A lightweight, modular, multilingual translation tool designed for low-resource environments like IoT systems. It uses TF-IDF and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to detect the input language, then dynamically loads the appropriate translation model into RAM, thus minimizing memory usage and maximizing portability.
> - **PredEmotion**: Emotion-specific sentiment classification neural network that can be derived for programs requiring emotion classification.
> - **ScalpNotifier**: Python-based multithreaded Facebook marketplace scalping program made using Selenium and BeautifulSoup for web scraping, SQlite3 for database management, and a Tornado Web Handler Graphical User Interface (GUI) made in HTML, CSS, and BootStrap5.
> - **SunnyPot**: Honeypot made using sockets in Python with IP blacklisting, dynamic port configuration, configurable responses, and the ability to handle multiple concurrent connections.
> - **AttendanceHandler**: JavaFX GUI application for parsing through CSV (Comma-Separated Values) formatted student attendance data stored in a custom Multimap container made using a HashMap with LinkedList buckets. 
> - **Scalpddit**: Reddit forum scalping program based on ScalpNotifier for maintaining notifications about new posts fitting expected criteria.
